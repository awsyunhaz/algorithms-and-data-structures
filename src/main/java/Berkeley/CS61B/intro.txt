1. All code in Java must be part of a class.
2. For code to run we need public static void main(String[] args)

Variables
1. Statically typed: Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared a specific type, which can never change.
2. Types are verified before the code even runs!!!

Static typing
Good:
a. Catches certain types errors, easier on the programmer to debug
b. Type errors can (almost) never occur on the end user's computer
c. Easier to read and reason about code
d. Codes run more efficiently, e.g. no need to do expensive runtime type checks
Bad:
a. Code is more verbose
b. Less general. There is a way around this in Java(generics)


Functions
1. Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.
   A function that is part of a class is called a "method".
   So in Java, all functions are methods.
2. All parameters of a function must have a declared type,
   and the return value of the function must have a declared type.
   Functions in Java return only one value!
